<h1><a name="about">About</a></h1>

<p>Renjin is a JVM-based interpreter for the <a
    href="http://www.r-project.org">R language for statistical computing</a>.
This project is an initiative of <a
    href="http://www.bedatadriven.com">BeDataDriven</a>, an analytics company
based in the Netherlands.</p>

<h2>Next Generation R on the JVM</h2>

<p>Over the past two decades, the R language for statistical computing has
emerged as the de facto standard for analysts, statisticians, and scientists.
Today, a wide range of enterprises &ndash;from pharmaceuticals to
insurance&ndash; depend on R for key business uses.  Renjin is a new
implementation of the R language and environment for the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM), designed for handling big data sets and seamless integration with other
enterprise systems such as databases and application servers.</p>

<h2>Why Renjin?</h2>

<h3>Bigger data</h3>

<p>R has been traditionally limited by the need to fit data sets into memory,
and working with even modest sets of data can quickly exhaust memory due to
historical limitations in the original R interpreter’s implementation.</p>

<p>Renjin allows R scripts to transparently interact with data wherever it’s
stored, whether that’s on disk, in a remote database, or in the cloud.</p>

<p>While there have been attempts to bring big data to the original
interpreter, these have generally provided a parallel set of data structures
and algorithms, threatening a fragmentation of the language and platform.
Renjin, in contrast, allows existing R code to run on larger datasets with no
modification, using R’s familiar and standard data structures and
algorithms.</p>

<h3>Better performance</h3>

<p>Renjin offers performance improvements in executing R code on several fronts:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vector operations:</strong> Renjin’s deferred computation
    engine automatically parallelizes and optimizes vector operation to run an
    order of magnitude faster, without the memory demands of computing
    intermediate structures [2012Q4]</li>
    <li><strong>Matrix operations:</strong> Renjin allows the user to plugin
    best-of-class implementations of BLAS, LAPACK, and FFT, for example:
    <ul><li>A platform-independent pure-Java implementation (netlib-java)</li>
        <li>Intel’s Math Kernel Library</li>
        <li>AMD’s Core Math Library</li>
        <li>Nvidia Cuda blas library [2013Q1]</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>Scalar operations:</strong> Renjin will compile frequently used
    portions of R code to JVM byte code on the fly, dramatically increasing
    performance of R’s notorious performance on for loops and other predominantly
    scalar code [2013Q2]</li>
</ul>

<p>These improvements make it possible to perform real-time analyses using
complex models.</p>

<h3>Cloud-ready</h3>

<p>Renjin enables R developers to deploy their code to Platform-as-a-Service
providers like Google Appengine, Amazon Beanstalk or Heroku without worrying
about scale or infrastructure. Businesses can therefore benefit from cutting
edge statistical software without having to buy and maintain expensive
hardware.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://renjindemo.appspot.com/">try the live demo</a> of
the interpreter on Google Appengine to see Renjin in action.</p>

<h3>Seamless integration with the rest of the enterprise</h3>

<p>Built on the JVM, Renjin allows R code to interact directly with JVM
libraries and data structures, without the need for expensive data transfer or
brittle inter-process communication.</p>

<p>Java and Scala developers can expose their data directly to R scripts by
implementing a simple interface. To the R developer, the data looks no
different than a normal R data structure.</p>

<p>Renjin runs safely in multithreaded application servers, allowing embedders
to create as many independent “apartments” to run existing single-threaded R
code, or to allow multi- threaded access if the user’s R code is written in a
pure, functional manner.  Renjin allows developers to choose the right language
for the different components of an enterprise system, without worrying how
they’ll interact.</p>

<h3>More productive development cycle</h3>

<p>Many enterprises will prototype analyses and models in R because of it’s
ease of use, but then port the results to Java/C++ for production use, either
because of performance limitations or due to poor interoperability between the
original R VM and other enterprise systems.</p>

<p>With Renjin, analysts can move directly from prototype to production. R
scripts can be packaged as JARs and called directly from JVM-based environments
and referenced directly by other JVM languages like Java, Scala, JRuby, or
Clojure.</p>

<h3>Open-source and cutting-edge</h3>

<p>Like R itself, the Renjin source code is available under an open-source
license. That means you get to stand on the shoulders of giants at little or no
cost.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>As Renjin is a Java application it will run on any platform with a JVM
installed. Therefore, if you want to run Renjin, you need to have installed at
least version 6 (or greater) of the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE). If you
haven't, then download and install it from <a
    href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The Swing-based GUI is provided as a trial version. Download the .jar file and run it using the following command:</p>

<pre>
  <code>java -jar renjin-swing-sample-0.7.0-RC3-SNAPSHOT.jar</code>
</pre>

<p>The Debian package can be installed on Ubuntu Linux using the following command:</p>

<pre>
  <code>sudo dpkg -i renjin-debian-package-{{ site.renjin-current }}.deb</code>
</pre>

<p>After this, you can start Renjin by simply typing <code>renjin</code> on your command line.</p>
