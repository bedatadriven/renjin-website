Congratulations to [Ce Gao](http://gaocegege.com/), who has just released an early version of 
[Processing.R](https://processing-r.github.io/) that uses Renjin to
enables users to write Processing sketches using the R language. The mode can be installed in the Processing 
Development Environment (PDE).

Check out their GitHub [Repo](https://github.com/gaocegege/Processing.R)
as well as Processing.R [tutorials](https://processing-r.github.io/tutorials/)

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning
how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software 
literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands
of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.

Renjin was designed to making embedding R within other systems much easier, so it's a great to see
these kinds of projects take advantage of Renjin in this way and extend the R language's reach into
this visual arts community.
