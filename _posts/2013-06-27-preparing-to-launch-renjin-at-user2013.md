title: Preparing to launch Renjin at UseR!2013
---

We are pleased to announce that we will be officially launching Renjin at the
[User!2013 conference](http://www.edii.uclm.es/~useR-2013/), which will be held
July 9-13 in Albacete, Spain. Together with an official release version, we are
preparing a new website with updated documentation and much more.

After almost three years of development at
[BeDataDriven](http://www.bedatadriven.com), we believe Renjin has now reached
a state in which its potential can be fully utilized. With a fresh new logo and
website at [renjin.org](http://www.renjin.org) we're ready to push
R programming in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to the next level.

Renjin has been used in production environments by ourselves and a number of
other people. With this launch we hope to get more people to give Renjin a try
and to give feedback. So come and see us at the conference or get in touch with
us via Twitter ([@bedatadriven](https://twitter.com/bedatadriven) and
