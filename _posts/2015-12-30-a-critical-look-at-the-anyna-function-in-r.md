The `anyNA()` function was introduced in GNU R in version 3.1.0 using what has
become a fairly common approach to solving performance issues in GNU R. In this
article I want to take a critical look at this function: what problem is it
trying to address and how? In particular, I will argue that the solution is
less than ideal and that the design of Renjin's R interpreter provides a much
more flexible approach to performance improvement.

When we presented our work on Renjin during the
[R Summit in Copenhagen](/blog/2015-06-28-renjin-at-rsummit-2015.html)
I briefly touched on my dismay at the introduction of the `anyNA()` function.
But before I tell you about what is wrong with this function I will explain why
it was introduced in the first place.

## History of GNU R's anyNA() function

Back in 2006,
[Henrik Bengtsson porposed the `has.na()` function on the r-devel mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2006-April/037202.html)
and
[asked about it again in August 2007](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2007-August/046611.html).
Why? Because he correctly observed that `any(is.na(x))` is (unnecessarily)
expensive and thus inefficient for a large vector `x`. Internally, GNU R will
first create a logical vector to store the result of `is.na(x)` and then loop
over the full result to determine if any elements are `NA`.

About 5.5 years later Tim Hesterberg, who participated in the discussion about
`anyNA()` in 2007,
[filed a request to enhance GNU R](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15239)
with the addition of the `anyNA()` function and provided a C implementation
which was incorporated into GNU R in version 3.1.0. The C implementation is
very efficient because it doesn't assign the intermediate result and it stops
looking once it finds the first `NA` element. If we were to program this
solution in R, it could look like the following implementation[^1]:

```r
anyNA <- function(x) {
  i <- 1
  repeat {
    if (is.na(x[i])) return(TRUE)
    i <- i + 1
    if (i > length(x)) return(FALSE)
  }
}
```

Of course, the C implementation will be compiled to machine code so it will be
much faster than the R implementation.

So far so good.

## My critique on anyNA()

So what is wrong with this approach? This is what I think (in no particular order):

  * It only solves one particular problem, but leaves many similar problems
unresolved. All three examples below will not benefit from the optimization in
`anyNA()` if `x` is a very large vector. So instead of solving the issue *under
the hood*, namely in the interpreter itself, a workaround is bolted onto the
side of it.
```r
y <- is.na(x); any(y)
any(is.na(x) | is.na(y))
all(!is.na(x))
```
  * The introduction of a specialized function increases the number of
functions in R's *base* package and thus clutters the API making it harder for
newcomers to grasp which functions they should use. A better idea would be to
collect these kinds of functions in a separate package and to make this
a recommended package.
  * There is another function which could have served as an example of what
`anyNA()` should return, namely `anyDuplicated()`. The latter function
essentially is a replacement for `any(duplicated(x))` but returns the index of
the first duplicate, not `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Aside from the question which
output makes more sense, it would have been more consistent to let `anyNA()`
also return the index of the first `NA` in `x`.
  * to make matters worse, the [bugzilla
issue](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15239) shows that
a discussion about the name of the function, came **after** it was released in
R. It could have been named `anyMissing()` or `hasNA()` depending on who was
the committer and his or her mood on the day of the commit. This tells me that
R's API (i.e. the set of functions available to the user) is not carefully
curated by R's developers.

## Other examples

If you think `anyNA()` is an isolated case, then you are wrong. Another example
is `paste0()`. The lack of creativity when naming this function should be
obvious. Most people will use `paste0()` instead of `paste()` but not because
it is faster in concatenating large vectors. They use it because they prefer
the default separator, `sep = ""` instead of `sep = " "` in the case of
`paste()`, and thus `paste0()` saves them from typing a few extra characters.

Or take `lengths(x)` which is a more efficient version of `sapply(x, length)`
for a large list `x`. This function was
[committed to R's code base by Michael Lawrence on February 6, 2015](https://github.com/wch/r-source/commit/957ab86995f91d056fce6dcc9e5a2c42477a1b03)
seemingly without any prior discussion on whether this is a useful addition to
R's already extensive list of functions in the base package. A discussion may
have taken place off-line, but all we have is a mention in the project's NEWS
file.

## Renjin's implementation of the anyNA() function

It just so happens that we had already solved the inefficiency of
`any(is.na(x))` in Renjin when the `anyNA()` function was introduced to R. In
fact, this solution was made very easy by the high level of abstraction in the
data types in Renjin's interpreter.

The following figure is taken from the section
[Overview of Renjinâ€™s type system](http://docs.renjin.org/en/latest/moving-data-between-java-and-r-code.html#overview-of-renjin-s-type-system)
in Renjin's documentation.

![Renjin's type system hierarchy](http://docs.renjin.org/en/latest/_images/renjin-class-hierarchy.png)

At the top you see R's well-known *SEXP* object type, followed by the *Vector*
and *AtomicVector* Java interfaces. The latter includes classes for the six
atomic vector types in the R language, one of which is the *LogicalVector*
type. When the `is.na(x)` function is called in Renjin and the vector `x` has
more than 100 elements, the interpreter will not allocate any memory. Instead
it will return a special type of the *LogicalVector* class which is
appropriately named *IsNaVector*. So Renjin knows that this vector is a result
of calling `is.na()` on the (known) vector `x` but it will not materialize this
vector until it really needs to. In a sense, the *IsNaVector* class returns
a 'view' of `is.na(x)`. Calling the `any()` function will then loop over the
elements of the view and return `TRUE` as soon as it finds an element equal to
`NA`. Like in GNU R's implementation of `anyNA()` no vectors, aside from `x`
itself[^2], are materialized in the process.

With this issue already solved in Renjin, all we had to do to implement
`anyNA()` was to provide a simple stub which we put in the appropriately named
[renjinStubs.R](https://github.com/bedatadriven/renjin/blob/c63d20d9d2aadc28c416237cf41c13e1811d9417/core/src/main/R/base/renjinStubs.R)
file.

## Conclusion

I have argued that the addition of the `anyNA()` function to GNU R's *base*
package solves only a narrow part of the problem and that the naming and
behavior of `anyNA()` (and similar functions) creates a bloated and
inconsistent API. My advice to people is not to use these functions unless
absolutely necessary: it will make your code more concise and elegant.

We have designed Renjin's R interpreter in such a way that we can implement
broader improvements to the memory usage and execution speed of R programs
without adding more functions. We believe that users should not have to rewrite
their R programs to achieve faster code execution or to reduce memory
requirements.

Convinced? Curious? [Download Renjin](/downloads.html) and
give it a try!

[^1]: note that `anyNA()` nowadays does a little more than just replace
`any(is.na())`. It is a generic function with a `recursive=FALSE` argument
which was added in R version 3.2.0.

[^2]: there are some examples in which even the vector `x` is not materialized.
For example if `x <- seq(10^6)` then Renjin will use a special class called
*DoubleSequence* to efficiently represent this long sequence of numbers in memory.
