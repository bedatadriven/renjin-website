On July 5th, 2015 the one-day workshop
[RIOT 2015 R Implementation, Optimization and Tooling Workshop](http://2015.ecoop.org/track/RIOT-2015-papers)
was held in Prague: 

> "RIOT 2015 is a one-day workshop dedicated to exploring
future directions for development of R language implementations and tools."

If you missed
[our presentation at the R Summit in Copenhagen](/blog/2015-06-28-renjin-at-rsummit-2015.html)
in June, then this video is a great way to learn more about our work on
deferred evaluations and optimizations in Renjin. This work is the result of
[a collaboration between BeDataDriven and Hannes Mühleisen from CWI](http://www.bedatadriven.com/news/2014/collaboration-with-cwi.html)
which is sponsored by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research.
