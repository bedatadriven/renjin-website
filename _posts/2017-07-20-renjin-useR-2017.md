title: "Renjin at UseR! 2017"
excerpt: The Renjin team gave presentations on the new renjin package, advances in S4 support in Renjin, and 
    the latest progress in optimizations.

This year, [UseR!](https://user2017.brussels/) was held in our backyard in Brussels so the whole Renjin team
was able to join. It was really terrific to see how much the R community continues to grow!

During the conference, Alex had a chance to speak about the new `renjin` package that allows you to load
Renjin directly from GNU R or RStudio and delegate performance-critical parts of your code to Renjin. 
Consider it an alternative to manually translating your R code to C or C++:

# RIOT 2017

We also co-hosted the 2017 [R Implementation, Optimization and Tooling (RIOT) Workshop](https://riotworkshop.github.io/) together with
Lukas Stadler from Oracle and Jan Vitek from Northeastern.

This is the third RIOT workshop, and again, an amazing opportunity to interact with those a deep knowledge of 
the R language, virtual machines, and compilers. 

Parham presented his work to integrate S4 dispatch into Renjin's Just-in-time compiler, and Alex spoke about our efforts to unify
the Renjin's high-level Vector Pipeliner with the more low-level JIT loop compiler.
