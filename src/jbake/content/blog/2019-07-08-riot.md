excerpt=Join us for a deep dive into R Implementation, Optimization and
    Tooling (RIOT) on Thursday, July 11th in Toulouse
~~~~~~

This Thursday, we're excited to co-host the fourth [workshop on
R Implementation, Optimization and Tooling (RIOT)](https://riotworkshop.github.io/),
during the 2019 UseR! Conferencce in Toulouse.

The workshop brings together those working on the internals of
the GNU R virtual machine as well as those working on alternative
implementations such as Renjin, for a deep dive into the R language,
compilers, and interpreter optimizations.

I'm especially excited to join Luke Tierney, the author of GNU R's
bytecode compiler, together with Stepan Sindelar and Jan Vitek for
a panel discussion on the challenges of compiling the R language which
is famously dynamic.
