excerpt=There is a growing interest in combining Spark with Renjin, because Renjin and Spark are both Java-based tools. Here we highlight some these projects.
~~~~~~


Researchers from Purdue University and Huawei Technologies have developed 
a new framework called **RABID** which combines **Spark** with **Renjin**.

The authors choose to use Renjin as the default R interpreter because “*it 
[Renjin], like Spark, is implemented in Java, and consequently can be better 
integrated with Spark*”. According to the study, by using Renjin, worker 
processes can share the cached dataset copy of Spark worker and, hence, 
“*reduce both latency and memory overheads*”. In subsequent study, the authors 
used RABID with their VM scheduling algorithm for efficient scheduling of 
Virtual Machines in a data center, reducing the number of physical machines 
by 15% and helped to make our planet more green.

David Russell (onetapbeyond) has also written an Apache Spark package called 
Apache Spark Renjin Executer (REX) “*to let Scala and Java developers use R 
from Spark*.”

In our October newsletter we informed you about improvements we made to Renjin 
as part of our collaboration with a US-based medical technology company to 
integrate Renjin in their Spark cluster. Read the newsletter [here](http://eepurl.com/cjeB0f).


Finally, related to this subject is a recent post about using [Renjin on Google's Cloud Dataflow service](https://medium.com/google-cloud/cloud-dataflow-can-autoscale-r-programs-for-massively-parallel-data-processing-492b57bd732d#.1z4lecdvw). 
Like Spark, it is a Java-based service which allows you to build data analysis 
pipelines to be executed in parallel on Google's massive computing infrastructure. 
Renjin allows you to integrate an R interpreter in these pipelines, which is 
impossible to do with GNU R.


Tell us about your experience with R(enjin) and Spark!
