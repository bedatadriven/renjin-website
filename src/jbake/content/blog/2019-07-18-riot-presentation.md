excerpt=At RIOT 2019, Alex recapped some recent developments in the Renjin project, and gave an overview of the growing role that compilers have played in making an JVM-based R interpreter a reality.

I was really excited to co-host the fourth [RIOT workshop](https://riotworkshop.github.io/), co-located
with UseR! 2019 in Toulouse. I've personally learned a lot from the
previous RIOT workshops, and was delighted to welcome a big crowd to
the workshop.

My colleague Maarten-Jan made a rough recording of my talk:

What I wanted to communicate was how the project was how the project
initially started as a "rewrite" of GNU R, and has now evolved into
a set of tools that automatically transforms millions of lines of C,
C++, Fortran and R code to meet new needs and run in new environments.

Renjin does provide and new and hopefully improved interpreter and
Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler built on the JVM, but the lion's share of
the R community's enormous investment in numerical and statistical routines
is transformed rather than replaced.

My [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VS3AHqTzuzIdH5NZz7w3974tmh2M9LqrhCprDMwUHhg) are also available.

We had a full day of great talks, including:

* [The R Bytecode Compiler and VM](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~luke/talks/Riot-2019.pdf) by Luke Tierney
* [R Melts Brains](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2b4w34my0kokrrm/RIOT.pdf?dl=0) from Jan Vitek

Will post more links as they become available!
