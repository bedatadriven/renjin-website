excerpt=Announcing Renjin 3.5 BETA
~~~~~~

We're excited to annnounce the first beta builds for Renjin 3.5!

[Download](https://renjin.org/repo/dist/renjin-3.5-beta42.zip) a command-line distribution, or
take a look at the [project setup](http://docs.renjin.org/en/latest/library/project-setup.html)
docs to add the beta to your Java project.

A few of the highlights include:

### Full compatibility with GNU R 3.5.3

Renjin has been updated to include new and updated functions from
GNU R 3.5.3, including those from the stats and other core packages.
Please help us by reporting any inconsistencies to our
[GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/bedatadriven/renjin/issues).

### Graphics support

Thanks to our [GCC-Bridge toolchain](/blog/2016-01-31-introducing-gcc-bridge.html), Renjin can now offer full support
for R graphics, grDevices, and grid packages, as well as packages
like ggplot2 that depend on them.

Renjin 3.5 supports both R's `ps` and `pdf` devices, which should
produce identical output to GNU R 3.5.3, as well as `svg`, raster, and
interactive devices via Java's Graphics 2D API.

### Tidyverse and more

Builds of the latest versions of popular tidyverse packages
like [ggplot2](https://packages.renjin.org/package/org.renjin.cran/ggplot2)
are now available on packages.renjin.org. 

## Still to come

We are shooting for the first Generally Available (GA) release of
Renjin 3.5 early August.

In the meantime, please be patient while all 15,000 CRAN and
BioConduct packages are built and tested against the latest builds,
and as we fix remaining bugs for the GA release.
