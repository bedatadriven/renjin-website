renjin-docs
===========

Documentation for [Renjin](https://github.com/bedatadriven/renjin), the R
interpreter for the JVM. Actually, this repo contains pretty much all of the
material for the Renjin website.

The documentation is written in the markdown format and uses
[Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) with a [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html) 
plugin for building HTML pages.

Dependencies
------------

Make sure you have Ruby and Jekyll (version 1.0.2 or higher) installed. Then
install the pandoc-ruby gem with the following command:

    gem install pandoc-ruby

Usage
-----

In the `renjin-docs` folder do `jekyll-build` to compile the site, which will
end up in the `_site` folder. Then do `jekyll serve` (or `jekyll serve --watch`
to regenerate the site on-the-fly) to serve the site at `localhost:4000`.
