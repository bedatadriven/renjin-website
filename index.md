Welcome to the documentation for Renjin, the R interpreter for the Java Virtual Machine. There are three types of guides:

* [for developers]({{ site.url }}/developers/) who want to include Renjin in their Java projects, and
* [for contributors]({{ site.url }}/contributors/) who want to help with the development of Renjin itself.
