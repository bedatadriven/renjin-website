excerpt=The DALI workshop brought together an amazing group of scientists, language implementors, and VM-wonks in one room last week. So many great ideas!
~~~~~~

Last week I had a chance to join the [National Science Foundation Workshop on Dynamic Languages for
Scalable Data Analytics](http://www.dynali.org/talks.html), or [#dali13](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dali13)
and share an [update](/assets/downloads/Renjin_Road_DALI.pdf) on Renjin's design and progress towards full compatibility with GNU R.

Besides getting a chance to see Beautiful Indianpolis for the first time, it was really
an incredible group that brought together scientists with real data scalability problems,
and those of us who are trying to build solutions.

I learned a lot, on topics diverse as concurrent garbage collection, automatic parallization, 
to VM design. 

Here are some links to projects I'm excited about:

  + Big thanks to [Tomas](http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/tkaliber/) and [Floreal](http://www.labri.fr/perso/fmoranda/)
    the Purdue team for walking me through their research
    into a [self-rewriting AST interpreter for R](https://github.com/allr/fastr). 
    Many great ideas that can be integrated into Renjin!
  
  + Duncan Temple Lang is working on [Rllvm](https://github.com/duncantl/Rllvm) a package
    for GNU R that allows you to translate R code to LLVM IR, play with it, and then compile
    to native code.
    
  + With [MacLab](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/mclab/), the McGill University crew is working 
    on an open-source toolkit for analyzing and compiling Matlab code. It sounds like they
    face many similiar challenges that an R (re)implemention does as Matlab also lacks
    a formal specification. 
    
  + Hadley Wickham gave an update on [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr), which also 
    uses deferred computation to improve performance on data frame operations, but written
    largely in user space. Very curious about the C++ interpreter for R expressions!
      
  + [Ryan Newton](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~rrnewton/homepage.html)
    [Data.Array.Accelerate](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/accelerate) 
    with me, which is a DSL for array
    computations embedded in Haskell with pluggable backends targeting CUDA, OpenCL, etc.
    Conceptually very similar to Renjin's Vector Pipeliner, and much to learn from the
    implementation. (Thanks [Ryan]!)
    
  + [Chandra Krintz](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ckrintz/) spoke about [StochSS](http://stochss.org)
    project that aims to provide stochiastic simulation as a service for life science
    researchers, using the [AppScale platform](http://www.appscale.com/), an open source clone of AppEngine.
    Renjin makes it MUCH easier to leverage the AppEngine/AppScale platform, so I'm excited
    about potential for collaboration here.
    
Thanks to Jan Vitek for organizing another great opportunity for collaboration!
